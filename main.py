  Python provides another composite data type called a dictionary, which is similar to a list in that it is a collection of objects.

  Here's what you'll learn in this tutorial: You'll cover the basic characteristics of Python dictionaris and learn how to access and manage dictionary data.
  Once you have finished this tutorial, you should have a good sense of when a dictionary is the appropriate data type to use, and how to do so.

  Dictionaries and lists share the following characteristics:
  - Both are mutable.
  - Both are dynamic. They can grow and shrink as needed.
  - Both can be nested. A list can contain another list.
  A dictionary can contain another dictionary.
  A dictionary can also contain a list, and vice versa.

  Dictionaries differ from lists primary in how elements are accessed:
  - List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing.
  - Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.
